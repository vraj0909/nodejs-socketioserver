/* NOTE
   I am running this node on my pc which i can access locally to use it in app i have to put this on a live server.  
   So for now i am using ngrok to make this local server live on internet so i can use it with niotron builder for Socket.io app
   For more info about how to use ngrok visit https://ngrok.com/
   It'll generate a random URL like http://93ad60ede325.ngrok.io/ this is your server URL.
